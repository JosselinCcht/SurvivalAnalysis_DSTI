# SurvivalAnalysis_DSTI


In this Survival Analysis project, we performed a survival analysis in R using a semi-parametric Cox regression model on a breast Cancer dataset.
Our method, results and analysis can be found inside the pdf file untitled "Survival Analysis Report".

## Data:
The dataset was taken from the kaggle website: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gunesevitan/breast-cancer-metabric/data 
The CSV files can also directly be downloaded from the Data Folder.

## Code:
The main code used to lead to our report results can be found inside the "main.R" R file.
DatasetStructure.R Contains a small visual analysis to understand the structure of our dataset, distribution of parameters and correlation between us as a preliminary work.
All required packages can be found at the beginning of the script and need to be installed by the user if needed.
